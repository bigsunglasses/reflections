How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Line by line comparison of a fewer numbers of lines (than if I had to search through the entire program)
  
How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I can fall back to an earlier version if subsequent changes break the code--
		I wouldn't have to start from scratch to recover functionality.
		
	I can compare various versions with different features more easily.
	
	I can assist others in finding their bugs--improved team collaboration.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pro--the file system isn't overloaded with lots of very similar files 
		that may have insignificant differences between them.
		
	Pro--more aware of the changes that were made--
		maybe label the file with the significant change and that would be useful to others as well.
		
	Pro--commits occur at logical points in the coding process
		
	Con--may forget to commit thus having several major changes between the most recent and current commit.
	
	Con--if coding is disrupted (power outage, reboot, etc.) and no recent commit has occurred, the changes are lost.
	
Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    No clue!

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    use git log to list all of the recent commits and then use git diff file1 file2 to list the specific differences between the files.
	
How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You can always revert back to a working copy, so breaking code is not permanent.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Nothing currently, but I will be assisting students who are writing code for Science Olympiad 
		and will need to manage and share files, so I want to be able to assist them with version control.
